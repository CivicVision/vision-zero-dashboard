		<h4>Data Update Frequency</h4>
		<p>Every day the data from the Open Data Portal is updated with new data released by the PD. Every day at 2am the information on this site will be updated as well.</p>
		<h4>Data Background</h4>
		<p>Currently the available Open Data is very limited. Only a little information is provided. That's why this page is limited in the information it provides. But as soon as more data will be made available by the city I will update this site.
		<br/>
		The Open Data Team from the Performance &amp; Analytics Department of the City is working on improving all data that they put out. I'm very glad for the work they do.
